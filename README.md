# Trafic-Sign-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
          In the world of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in technologies, many researchers and big companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc. are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. So, for achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles should be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly.    
Automatic detection and recognition of traffic signs is very important and could potentially be used for driver assistance to reduce accidents and eventually in driverless automobiles. In this project, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to develop an Autonomous Traffic Sign recognition system. The proposed system works in real time detecting and recognizing traffic sign images. The contribution of this project is also contains a  dataset which used is the GTSRB (German traffic sign recognition benchmark). It contains a Train folder that has traffic sign images in 43 different classes, a Test folder that has over 12,000 images for testing purposes. A test.csv file that contains the path of the test images along with their respective classes.
The images were taken from different angles and including other parameters and conditions. A total of 50,000 images were collected to form the database which we named  Traffic and Road Signs GTSRB (German traffic sign recognition benchmark). The CNN architecture was used with varying parameters in order to achieve the best recognition rates. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN architecture achieved an accuracy of 100%, thus higher than those achieved in similar previous studies.  This project provides the result that user will get a voice message if The vehicle pass through the traffic sign on the road  . The  user will follow the instruction as per  the voice over .
